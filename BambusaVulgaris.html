                  <li>Description</li>
                    <p><b>Clums</b>
					   <br>Bambusa vulgaris has lemon-yellow culms with green stripes and dark green leaves. Stems are not straight, not easy to split, inflexible, thick-walled, and initially strong. Culms are basally straight or flexuose, drooping at the tips. Culm walls are slightly thick. Nodes are slightly inflated. Several branches develop from mid-culm nodes and above. Culm leaves are deciduous with dense pubescence. Leaf blades are narrowly lanceolate.</br>
					</p>
					<p><b>The inflorescence & fruiting</b>
					   <br>Flowering is not common, and there are no seeds. Fruits are rare due to low pollen viability caused by irregular meiosis.</br>
                    </p>
				 <li>Distribution and habitat</li>
					<p>Common bamboo is the most widely grown bamboo throughout the tropics and subtropics. Although mostly known only from cultivation, spontaneous, escaped, and naturalized populations exist throughout the tropics and subtropics in and outside Asia. B. vulgaris is widely cultivated in East, Southeast, and South Asia, as well as tropical Africa including Madagascar.</p>
                  <li>Uses</li>
					<p>Common bamboo has a wide variety of uses, including the stems used as fuel and the leaves used as fodder, though a large amount of ingestion of leaves is known to cause neurological disorder among horses.
					<br>It also has some disadvantages. Working and machining properties of the stems are poor, as they are not straight, not easy to split, and not flexible, but they are thick-walled and initially strong. Because of high carbohydrate content, stems are susceptible to attacks from fungi and insects such as powder post beetles. Protection from biological threats is essential for long-term use.</br>
					   <p><b>Ornamental</b>
					       <br>It is widely used as an ornamental plant, and is very popular as that. It often is planted as fences and border hedges. It is also planted a measure for erosion control.</br> 
					   </P>
					   <p><b>Construction</b>
					        <br>The stems or culms of B. vulgaris are used for fencing and construction.The culm is used to make many parts of boats including masts, rudders, outriggers, and boating poles. It also is used to make furniture, basketry, windbreakers, flutes, fishing rods, tool handles, stakes, weapons, bows for fishing nets, smoking pipes, irrigation pipes, distillation pipes, and more.It is used as raw material for paper pulp, especially in India.</br>
					   </p>
					  <p><b>Food</b>
					     <br>Young shoots of the plant, cooked or pickled, are edible and eaten throughout Asia. Yellow shoots remain buttercup yellow after cooking. A decoction of the growing tips is mixed with Job's tears to make a refreshing drink in Mauritius. The shoots are tender and whitish pink, and have a fair canning quality.</br>
					  </p>
					  <p><b>Indigenous medicine</b>
					     <br>Golden bamboo is considered in many traditions across Asia to have medicinal value. Many uses are found in herbal medicine, though the effects are not clinically proven. </br>
				      </p>
				 <li>Cultivation</li>
					<p>Though not suited for small yards, as it grows in large clumps, young plants of golden bamboo can be grown in large containers. Golden bamboo grows well in full sunlight or partial shade. Protection is important, as animals often graze on young shoots. In Tanzania, management of B. vulgaris cultivation entails clearing of the ground around clumps.</p>
